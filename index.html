    <!--- PROJECT NARRATIVE --->
    
    <p>Tower of Buns (TOB) is a lost artifact built by indigenous Hong Kong people to pray for peace in crisis. Ceremonious bun climbing contests were hosted on these towers since the 18th century, until the British colonial government banned it in 1978.</p>
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <p>To save the dying culture, the last bun tower is retrieved from 1978 and sent forward to the 2020 Black Rock Desert. After years of time travel, the monolith of white lotus buns transformed with its people into the TOB. It reimagines the future Hong Kong not by geography but by its migrating culture that evolved from people around the world, materialized in the form of buns.</p>

    <!--- PHILOSOPHY --->
    
    <p>With a long past of immigrants, HK had created its own identity by assimilating different cultures from many countries, well reflected in our buns.
At a time of crisis, we carry the hope and fear to save our culture as one of many who had left Hong Kong. By reviving a lost indigenous practice from Hong Kong in a foreign geography and time, the Tower of Buns explores the possibility of HK surviving as a nomadic culture rather than a locational culture. 
TOB can be read in a primitive way without its cultural context: a surreal pile of food in the desert. Adding to its past icon as peace, TOB also symbolizes a future of diversity with buns in various shapes, colors, and sizes. 
The fallen state of TOB acknowledges fear in our past, present & future: the fear for the tragic fall of 1978; the fear of cultural loss; fear of losing our identity; and fear of losing freedom.</p>
