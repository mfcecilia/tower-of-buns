    <p>Tower of Buns (TOB) is a lost artifact built by indigenous Hong Kong people to pray for peace in crisis. Ceremonious bun climbing contests were hosted on these towers since the 18th century, until the British colonial government banned it in 1978.</p>

    <p>To save the dying culture, the last bun tower is retrieved from 1978 and sent forward to the 2020 Black Rock Desert. After years of time travel, the monolith of white lotus buns transformed with its people into the TOB. It reimagines the future Hong Kong not by geography but by its migrating culture that evolved from people around the world, materialized in the form of buns.</p>
